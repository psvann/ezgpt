Would be useful to have a:
I input url
System scrapes all text docs on said URL
System puts them into RAG / VectorStore
System gives me chat interface to ask questions.
It's acutally the CVE summarizer, but for any docs site.

Self updating RAGs
With various data source connectors (crawlers, OCR, uploaders etc)
chat interface front-end, some community "sharables" based on public data... maybe a login to save your chats.
