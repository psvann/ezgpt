    "1. The software is developed and built in secure environments. Those environments are secured by the following actions, at a minimum:\n",

    "    1. Regularly logging, monitoring, and auditing trust relationships used for authorization and access:\n",
    "        1. to any software development and build environments; and\n",
    "        1. among components within each environment;\n",
    "    1. Enforcing multi-factor authentication and conditional access across the environments relevant to developing and building software in a manner that minimized security risk;\n",
    "    1. Taking consistent and reasonable steps to document as well as minimize use or inclusion of software products that create undue risk within the environments used to develop and build software;\n",
    "    1. Encrypting sensitive data, such as credentials, to the extent practicable and based on risk;\n",
    "    1. Implementing defensive cyber security practices, including continuous monitoring of operations and alerts and, as necessary, responding to suspected and confirmed cyber incidents;\n",
    "1. The software producer has made a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply chains by:\n",

    "1. The software producer employs automated tools or comparable processes in a good-faith effort to maintain trusted source code supply chains;\n",
    "1. The software producer maintains provenance data for internal and third-party code incorporated into the software;\n",
    "1. The software producer employs automated tools or comparable processes that check for security vulnerabilities. In addition:\n",
    "    1. The software producer ensures these processes operate on an ongoing basis and, at a minimum, prior to product, version, or update releases; and\n",
    "    1. The software producer has a policy or process to address discovered security vulnerabilities prior to product release; and\n",
